# 6502Assembler
**Author :** RÃ©mi Pelletier  
**Description :** A very basic assembler for the MOS Technology 6502 instruction set.  

## Goal  
Develop a mostly accurate assembler for the MOS Technology 6502 instruction set.  

## Motivations  
- Testing my emulation of the NES CPU (NTSC: Ricoh 2A03 / PAL: Ricoh 2A07).  
- Covering the basic aspects of developing an instruction set assembler.
- Providing other developers trying to emulate microprocessors based on the MOS Technology 6502 with a simple testing tool.  
  
## Considerations
